# Keyboard Shortcuts Reference Tables Overlaid on Desktop Wallpaper

This is how I ultimately... *finally* managed to get myself to integrate keyboard shortcuts habitually into my day-to-day workflow/general use. Even printing keyboard shortcuts reference tables out in beautiful/elegant styles and attaching the paper nearby my workstation seemed to be basically futile.

This solution - carefully overlaying the tables on wallpaper images - ended up being the ideal form of reference for me. 

The .xcf files in this repo are subject to use at any time, but frankly, they're hardly actual templates, anyway. 

If this happens to be as useful for others as it was for me - if the idea ends up actually soliciting any sort of serious attention, perhaps a true wallpaper engine can be created in the form of a GIMP macro.

## DIY

**To make your own with [GIMP](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp)** (precisely as I have been up to this point, anyway:)

1. Start by importing the wallpaper image you intend to use as a Layer.

2. Believe it or not, I believe the fastest means of transporting the actual "data" into GIMP is to find (or create yourself) a PDF including a two-column reference table of the shortcuts over a white background. Dragging and dropping the .pdf file over GIMP is probably the best way to introduce it to this idea, and I would advise you set the pixel density around 300 dpi just because.

3. ###### Crop out *just* the cells, leaving any headings/column labels behind.

4. Run color to alpha on the result and set the layer's blend mode to `Grain extract`.

5. Arrange to your preference!

6. Share your end result here!
